# ðŸ§ª Homelab Projects

Welcome to my Homelab Projects repository â€” a personal playground for my local projects.

This repo documents hands-on experiments, configurations, and automation I've implemented on local virtual machines using tools like **Vagrant**, **VirtualBox**, **Ansible**, **Terraform**, and more.
